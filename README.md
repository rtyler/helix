# Helix

Helix allows you to write Ruby classes in Rust without having to write the glue code yourself.

```rust
ruby! {
    class Console {
        def log(string: String) {
            println!("LOG: {}", string);
        }
    }
}
```

```shell
$ rake build
$ bundle exec irb
>> require "console"
>> Console.log("I'm in your Rust")
LOG: I'm in your Rust
 => nil
```

## Contributing

If you'd like to experiment with Helix, you can start with some of the examples in this repository.

Clone and download the Helix repository:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/tildeio/helix
$ cd helix
```

Navigate to the console example folder and bundle your `Gemfile`:
```shell
$ cd examples/console
$ bundle install
```

Run `rake irb` to build and start irb:
```shell
$ bundle exec rake irb
```

Try running some of the methods defined in `examples/console/src/lib.rs`:
```shell
> c = Console.new
Console { helix: VALUE(0x7fdacc19a6a0) }
 =>
> c.hello
hello
 => nil
> c.loglog('hello', 'world')
hello world
 => nil
```

To run all tests in the repository, run

```shell
rake install
rake
```
